# Trivia-Game

A simple trivia-style game that was developed to practice and demonstrate my software development skills, and help me brush up on my plant identification skills at the same time!

Press start when you're ready to begin the quiz. Photos of plant species will show up sequentially with several choices for their scientific name below.

After you select your answer from the choices, you will be informed if your answer is correct or incorrect. If your answer is incorrect, you will be informed of the correct choice.

The quiz will automatically move on to the next question until there are no more questions.

At the end of the quiz, you will be informed of the number of correct and incorrect answers. You will also be given an option to restart the quiz.

Careful, you only have a limited amount of time to answer each question!
